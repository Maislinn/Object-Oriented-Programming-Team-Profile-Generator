## Installation
 
Because this Challenge will require the use of the `Inquirer` package, ensure that you install and use Inquirer version 8.2.4. To do so, use the following command in your project folder: `npm i inquirer@8.2.4`.
 
## Usage
 
Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.
 
To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:
 
![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
 
## Credits
 
List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.
 
If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.
 
If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.
 
## License
 
The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## How to Contribute
 
If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
 
## Tests
 
Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
